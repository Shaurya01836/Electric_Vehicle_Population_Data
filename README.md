## Introduction

This project is focused on analyzing electric vehicle population data. The analysis includes exploring the distribution of electric vehicles by various attributes, trends over time, and other insightful visualizations to understand the electric vehicle market better.

## Dataset

- **File**: `Electric_Vehicle_Population_Data.csv`
- **Description**: This dataset contains information about electric vehicle registrations, including details such as the make, model, model year, electric range, and the state of registration.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

    git clone [https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git](https://github.com/Shaurya01836/Electric_Vehicle_Population_Data.git)
    

2. Change into the project directory:

    sh
    cd Electric_Vehicle_Population_Data
    

3. Install the required dependencies:

    sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt


## Usage

1. **Upload the Notebook**:
    - Open Google Colab and upload the `Electric_IBM_Project.ipynb` notebook.

2. **Run the Notebook**:
    - Run the cells in the notebook to perform the data analysis.
    - You will be prompted to upload the `Electric_Vehicle_Population_Data.csv` file during the notebook execution.

## Analysis and Visualizations

The analysis includes:

- **Distribution of Electric Vehicles by Make**: Visualized using bar plots to show the count of vehicles by make.
- **Distribution of Electric Vehicles by Model Year**: Bar plots to show the count of vehicles by model year.
- **Distribution by State**: Bar plots to visualize the number of electric vehicles registered in each state.
- **Distribution by Vehicle Type**: Visualized to show the count by different types of electric vehicles.
- **Trend of Electric Vehicle Registration Over Years**: Line plot to show the trend of vehicle registrations over the years.
- **Distribution of Electric Range**: Histogram to show the distribution of the electric range of vehicles.
- **Scatter Plot of Electric Range vs. Model Year**: Scatter plot to visualize the relationship between model year and electric range.
